# Description of App

Our team built a social media type web application where users of all age groups can upload images and have their images classified into different categories using Googleâ€™s Cloud Vision API. Users can also search for other users, follow them, and view their profiles as well to get a better sense of what their interests are. Lastly, users have a feed that displays photos uploaded by people they follow.
